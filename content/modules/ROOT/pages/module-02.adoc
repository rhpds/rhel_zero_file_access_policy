Now that we’ve seen how the daemon is configured, let’s see it in
action.

Switch to the user `+rhel+`.

[source,bash]
----
su - rhel
----

Let’s pull down a new application from an internet source, `+cowsay+`.
There is nothing inherently malicious about this binary, though it
provides a good example for our application control workflow.

[source,bash]
----
curl -L -O https://github.com/Code-Hex/Neo-cowsay/releases/download/v2.0.4/cowsay_2.0.4_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
----

Now, extract `+cowsay+` into the user’s home directory.

....
tar xsf cowsay_2.0.4_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
....

You should have no problems executing the `+cowsay+` binary:

[source,bash]
----
./cowsay "mooooo"
----

Let’s start up fapolicyd and see what happens:

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start fapolicyd
----

The password is `+redhat+`.

[source,bash]
----
redhat
----

Now run the `+cowsay+` command again.

[source,bash]
----
./cowsay "mooooo"
----

You’ll obtain the following error.

.opnotpermitted
image::opnotpermitted.png[opnotpermitted]

Great! Because the `+cowsay+` binary isn’t in the RPM database, or the
file-backed trust database configured at
`+/etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.trust+`, the execution is blocked.
